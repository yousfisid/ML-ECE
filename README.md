# ML-ECE

In order to validate one semester of our school curriculum, we had to carry out a Machine Learning project.
It was important to us to realize a project that could facilitate or help the realization of a task of one of our relatives using a Machine Learning algorithm.
That's why we decided to go for a rent price prediction algorithm. Indeed, we know people working in the Hostellar company which is a company renting real estate. 
The files associated with this project are the following:
-Copy of Airbnb.ipynb
-calendar.csv
-listings.csv
-Seasonal.csv
-Airbnb dataset
-Dataset explanation

However, after a lot of work on data cleaning, the time has come to learn... We only had a learning rate of 13% using a linear regression function, which is very very low.
Despite our attempts to improve our dataset in order to increase our learning rate, we didn't get it.

In fear of not having anything serious to propose for our defense, we decided to change dataset and start again from the beginning.
This is where the new project comes in: House Pricing. It remains in the continuity of the initial project but with the sale of houses instead of renting real estate.

The files associated with this project (HousePricing) are the following :
-HousePricing.ipynb
-train.csv
-test.csv
-data_description.txt
-Pub_HousePricing

In this project, using linear regression we managed to achieve a learning rate of 76% and we were also able to integrate the model into a website so that anyone could predict the price of a house.
